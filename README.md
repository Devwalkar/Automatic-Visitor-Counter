# Automatic-Visitor-Counter
A project based on keeping live attendance of a particular room

Description

Wastage of electricity is one of the main problems which we are facing now a days. In our home, school, colleges or industry we see that fan / lights are kept on even if there are nobody in the room or area / passage. This happens due to negligence or because we forgot to turn lights off or when we are in hurry. To avoid all such situations we have designed this project called “Automatic room light controller with visitor counter”. Main concept behind this project is known as “Visitor counter” which measures the number of persons entering in any room like seminar hall, conference room, classroom. This function is implemented using a pair of Infrared sensors. LCD display placed outside the room displays this value of person count. This person count will be incremented if somebody enters inside the room and at that time lights are turned on. And in reverse way, person count will be decremented if somebody leaves the room. When number of persons inside the room is zero, lights inside the room are turned off using a relay interface. In this way Relay does the operation of “Automatic room light controller”. Since this project uses 2 infrared sensors, it can be used as Bidirectional person counter as well.

Applications:
1. Digital Visitor Counter can be used in various rooms like seminar hall, conference hall where the capacity of room is limited and should not be exceeded. Project will display actual number of persons inside the room.
2. “Automatic Room light Controller with Visitor Counter” can be used in class rooms, study rooms in colleges.
3. This project can also be used in our home because many times we come out of our bedroom or any other room and we forgot to turn off the room light.
4. This project can be used in Cinema halls, multiplex, malls as well as in temples to count the number of person entering inside. So that these places should not get over crowded to avoid congestion.

Advantages:
1. Main advantage of this project is that it helps in energy conservation. Because when there is nobody inside the room then lights are automatically turned off.
2. Human efforts to count the number of person is eliminated. Since this project does the automatic person counting with the help of two sensors installed on door frame.

Future Development:
1. Voice alarm system can be added to indicate that room is full & persons can’t enter inside.
2. We can increase the maximum number of persons that can be counted by implementing the external EEPROM ic.
3. We can send this data to a remote location using mobile or internet.
